    <h1><strong>The NFL Super Bowl</strong></h1>
      <h2> The Origins</h2>
    <p>  The National Football League has been around for 98 years; however, the
      Super Bowl is a somewhat new game. The Super Bowl is currently the highest
      level of play in the NFL, and the people who play are decided by the best
      teams per division. Prior to the Super Bowl, the highest game was the
      Championship game. In 1967, the NFL decided that they would make the
      Championship game into the AFL-NFL World Championship Game. It was like
      this for three years until the leagues merges. When the AFL and NFL merged
      in 1970, the concepts changed. They decided to make the Super Bowl between
      the AFC Champion and the NFC Champion.</p>
        <h4><a href="/relative/superbowlvalue.html">The Profit</a></h4>
    <p> The Super Bowl has greatly changed since its founding in the mid-20th
      century. At first it started as a simple game played between the best teams
      in the league; but, it has transformed into a money making paradise for NFL
      and other advertisers alike. </p>
        <h4><a href="/relative/superbowlwinners.html">The Winners</a></h4>
    <p> Some teams have been specifically better than others in the Big Game,
      too. Teams like the 49ers boast records of 5-1, while others, like the
      Bills, have been there four times but have yet to be successful in getting
      the Lombardi Trophy.</p>
        <h4><a href=/relative/superbowlmvp.html>The Best of the Best</a></h4>
    <p> There is also a prestigiuos award that comes with winning winnig the
      Super Bowl, a Super Bowl MVP. The best performing player in the Big Game is given the
      Super Bowl MVP Award. </p>
